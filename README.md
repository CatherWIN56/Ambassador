Project 4: The Ambassador Restaurant Re-design
The Ambassador Restaurant is seeking to update their website. The Ambassador provides delicious Italian-American and pub food in the town of Houghton, MI. Their website does not currently reflect the quality of their offerings. By updating their website they hope to attract new customers, highlight their quality food, and stand out in a crowded restaurant market.

The current website can be found at: https://theambassadorhoughton.com/Links to an external site..

Goals of the New Website

Increase brand awareness. A fresh look and well-organized content will help attract new customers to the restaurant and make it easier for customers to order food.
Improved online presence with an updated website design. The current website feels cluttered and clumsily put together and doesn't do a great job of highlighting the Ambassador's story and offerings.
Increased usability. The website needs to make information easy to find, logical, and accessibleâ€”because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Ambassador is doing more takeout than ever, so this is a particular concern.
